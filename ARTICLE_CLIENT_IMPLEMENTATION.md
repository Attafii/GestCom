# Article-Client Relationship Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented the Article-Client relationship feature allowing articles to be linked to specific clients or marked as general (available to all clients).

## Implementation Date
Completed: 2024

## Features Implemented

### 1. Database Schema Changes
- **Article Model** (`lib/data/models/article_model.dart`)
  - Added optional `clientId` field (HiveField 7)
  - Updated `copyWith()`, `toJson()`, and `fromJson()` methods
  - Regenerated Hive TypeAdapter

### 2. Repository Layer
- **Article Repository** (`lib/data/repositories/article_repository.dart`)
  - Added `getArticlesByClient(String clientId, {bool? activeOnly})` - Get articles for specific client
  - Added `getGeneralArticles({bool? activeOnly})` - Get articles without client (general)
  - Updated `searchArticles()` to support optional `clientId` parameter for filtered searches

### 3. Provider Layer
- **Article Providers** (`lib/features/articles/application/article_providers.dart`)
  - Added `ArticleClientFilter` provider to manage client filter state
  - Updated `ArticleList.searchArticles()` to accept `clientId` parameter
  - Updated `ArticleList.filterByStatus()` to accept `clientId` parameter
  - Added `ArticleList.filterByClient()` method for client-specific filtering
  - Updated `ArticleSearchQuery.updateQuery()` to coordinate with client filter
  - Updated `ArticleActiveFilter.setFilter()` to coordinate with client filter

### 4. UI Components

#### Article Screen (`lib/features/articles/presentation/screens/article_screen.dart`)
**Search and Filters Section:**
- Added client filter dropdown after active status filter
- Three filter options:
  - "Tous les clients" - Show all articles
  - "Articles généraux" - Show only general articles (clientId = null)
  - Individual client names - Show articles for specific client

**Data Table:**
- Added "Client" column between "Désignation" and "Traitements"
- Displays client name or "Général" badge for general articles
- Increased `minWidth` from 900 to 1000 to accommodate new column

**Table Header:**
- Updated count display to show active filters
- Example: "5 article(s) actif(s), pour Client ABC"

#### Article Form Dialog (`lib/features/articles/presentation/widgets/article_form_dialog.dart`)
**Form Fields:**
- Added client selection dropdown
- Positioned after designation field
- Options:
  - "Article général (tous les clients)" - Default option
  - Individual client names from client list
- Helper text: "Laissez vide pour un article général"

**Save Logic:**
- Updated both create and update paths to include `clientId`
- Preserves client association when editing articles

## Technical Details

### Filter Coordination
The implementation coordinates three filters:
1. **Search Query** - Text search on reference/designation
2. **Active Status** - Filter by active/inactive status
3. **Client** - Filter by client or general articles

All filters work together and are properly coordinated through Riverpod providers.

### Special "general" Filter Value
- UI uses "general" string to represent general articles filter
- Provider translates "general" to `null` for repository queries
- This distinction allows filtering for articles without a client vs. showing all articles

### Data Flow
```
UI (Dropdown) → ArticleClientFilter Provider → ArticleList Provider → Repository → Hive Database
     ↓
  "general" → null → WHERE clientId == null → General Articles
  clientId → clientId → WHERE clientId == value → Client Articles
  null → null → No filter → All Articles
```

## Files Modified

### Models
- `lib/data/models/article_model.dart` - Added clientId field

### Repositories
- `lib/data/repositories/article_repository.dart` - Added client filtering methods

### Providers
- `lib/features/articles/application/article_providers.dart` - Added client filter provider and updated existing providers

### UI Screens
- `lib/features/articles/presentation/screens/article_screen.dart` - Added client column and filter dropdown

### UI Widgets
- `lib/features/articles/presentation/widgets/article_form_dialog.dart` - Added client selection dropdown

## Build Status
✅ **Build Successful**
- `flutter build windows` completed without errors
- Build time: 88.9s
- Output: `build\windows\x64\runner\Release\gestcom.exe`

✅ **Code Generation Successful**
- `flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs` completed
- Time: 1m 14s
- Generated 4 outputs including Riverpod providers

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Create Articles**
   - Create general article (no client selected)
   - Create client-specific article
   - Verify both save correctly

2. **Filter Testing**
   - Test "Tous les clients" shows all articles
   - Test "Articles généraux" shows only general articles
   - Test individual client filter shows only that client's articles
   - Test filters work with active/inactive status filter
   - Test filters work with search

3. **Edit Articles**
   - Edit general article and assign to client
   - Edit client article and make general
   - Edit client article and change client
   - Verify changes persist

4. **Integration Testing**
   - Verify articles appear correctly in reception/livraison based on client
   - Verify article selection in forms respects client context
   - Test article search across all modules

## Design Consistency
✅ Maintained existing design patterns:
- Same dropdown style as active status filter
- Consistent spacing and layout
- Table column styling matches existing columns
- Form field styling consistent with other fields
- Badge styling for "Général" indicator

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future development:

1. **Bulk Operations**
   - Assign multiple articles to a client at once
   - Move articles between clients in bulk

2. **Client Article Templates**
   - Copy article structure from one client to another
   - Create article templates for new clients

3. **Article Access Control**
   - Restrict article visibility based on user roles
   - Client-specific permissions

4. **Reporting**
   - Articles per client report
   - General vs. client-specific article statistics
   - Usage analytics by client

## Notes

- General articles (clientId = null) are available to all clients
- Client-specific articles are only available when that client is selected
- The filter dropdown in ArticleScreen provides quick access to client-specific views
- The implementation preserves backward compatibility with existing articles (they become general articles)
