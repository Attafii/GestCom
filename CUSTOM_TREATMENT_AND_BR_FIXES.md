# Custom Treatment and BR Number Column Fixes

## Date: October 2, 2025

## Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: Custom Treatments Showing as "Inconnu"

**Problem**: When adding a manual/personalized treatment through "add personalized treatment", it was displaying as "Inconnu" (Unknown) in the treatments column of the Article screen.

**Root Cause**: Custom treatments were stored with IDs like `custom_timestamp` but the treatment name was only kept in a temporary `_customTreatmentNames` map that wasn't persisted with the article data.

**Solution**: Embedded the treatment name directly in the custom treatment ID.

#### Changes Made:

1. **ArticleFormDialog** (`lib/features/articles/presentation/widgets/article_form_dialog.dart`):
   - Modified custom treatment ID generation to include the treatment name
   - Format: `custom_timestamp_treatmentname` (spaces replaced with underscores)
   ```dart
   final customId = 'custom_${DateTime.now().millisecondsSinceEpoch}_${result['name'].replaceAll(' ', '_')}';
   ```

2. **ArticleScreen** (`lib/features/articles/presentation/screens/article_screen.dart`):
   - Updated `_buildTreatmentsList()` method to parse custom treatment IDs
   - Extracts treatment name from the ID format
   - Replaces underscores with spaces for display
   ```dart
   if (treatmentId.startsWith('custom_')) {
     final parts = treatmentId.split('_');
     if (parts.length > 2) {
       treatmentName = parts.sublist(2).join('_').replaceAll('_', ' ');
     } else {
       treatmentName = 'Traitement personnalisé';
     }
   }
   ```

### Issue 2: Missing BR Number Column in Reception Screen

**Problem**: The Bon de Réception (BR) table didn't display the BR number (numeroBR) field, making it difficult to identify specific reception documents.

**Solution**: Added a new "N° BR" column as the first column in the table.

#### Changes Made:

**ReceptionScreen** (`lib/features/reception/presentation/screens/reception_screen.dart`):

1. **Added "N° BR" DataColumn**:
   - Inserted as first column before "N° Commande"
   - Size: `ColumnSize.S` (small)
   
2. **Added numeroBR DataCell**:
   - Displays the `reception.numeroBR` value
   - Styled with bold font and primary color for visibility
   - Format examples: BR001, BR002, BR003, etc.

3. **Updated minWidth**:
   - Increased from 1000 to 1100 to accommodate the new column

```dart
DataColumn2(
  label: Text('N° BR'),
  size: ColumnSize.S,
),
// ... other columns

DataCell(
  Text(
    reception.numeroBR,
    style: TextStyle(
      fontWeight: FontWeight.bold,
      color: AppColors.primary,
    ),
  ),
),
```

## Testing

### Build Status
✅ **Build Successful** - 46.2s
- No compilation errors
- App launches successfully
- Hive database initialized correctly

### Verification Steps

**For Custom Treatments**:
1. Open Articles screen
2. Create a new article
3. Click "Ajouter un traitement personnalisé"
4. Enter treatment name (e.g., "Traitement Spécial")
5. Enter price
6. Save article
7. Verify treatment displays as "Traitement Spécial" instead of "Inconnu"

**For BR Number Column**:
1. Navigate to Réception screen
2. Verify "N° BR" column appears as first column
3. Check that BR numbers (BR001, BR002, etc.) are displayed correctly
4. Verify the column is properly styled with bold primary color

## Implementation Details

### Custom Treatment ID Format
- **New Format**: `custom_1696246800000_Traitement_Special`
- **Parts**:
  - `custom_` - Prefix identifier
  - `1696246800000` - Timestamp in milliseconds
  - `Traitement_Special` - Treatment name with spaces replaced by underscores

### Benefits
1. **Persistence**: Treatment name is permanently stored with the article
2. **Backward Compatibility**: Old custom treatments still work (show as "Traitement personnalisé")
3. **No Database Changes**: Works with existing data structure
4. **Self-Documenting**: ID contains human-readable information

### BR Column Benefits
1. **Better Identification**: Easy to reference specific BR documents
2. **Consistency**: Matches other document numbering (BL, Facture)
3. **User-Friendly**: Sequential numbering is intuitive
4. **Professional**: Matches standard business document practices

## Files Modified

1. `lib/features/articles/presentation/widgets/article_form_dialog.dart`
   - Updated custom treatment ID generation

2. `lib/features/articles/presentation/screens/article_screen.dart`
   - Enhanced treatment name extraction logic

3. `lib/features/reception/presentation/screens/reception_screen.dart`
